This folder is a placeholder for screenshots or a short video demonstrating the new toast notification changes.

How to add:

- Take screenshots (PNG/JPG) of the app showing a toast in different states (error, success, warning, info).
- Name them logically: `toast-error.png`, `toast-success.png`, `toast-warning.png`, `toast-info.png`.
- For video: record a short MP4 (10-20s) showing the toast appearing and auto-dismissing. Add as `toast-demo.mp4`.

Notes for reviewers:

- I cannot create images or videos in this commit. Please add screenshots or a short recording to this folder and attach them to the PR for visual verification.
